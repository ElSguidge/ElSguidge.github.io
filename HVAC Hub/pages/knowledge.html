                    Want to learn more about relay switching?
Try this electronic circuit simulator. <br>
The green color indicates a positive voltage. <br>
The gray color indicates ground.<br> 
A red color indicates negative voltage.  <br>
The moving yellow dots indicate current. <br>
To turn a switch on or off, just click on it. <br> 
If you move the mouse over any component of the circuit, 
you will see a short description of that component <br>
and its current state in the lower right corner of the window. <br>
Always remember to connect a resistance to any load.<br>

The primary and secondary circuits are connected via a pipe known as the “Low Loss Header” it is also sometimes referred 
to as the “Decoupler” or “Common Header”. The primary water flows into this to provide heated or chilled water to the 
secondary circuits. When the building is at maximum load and is demanding 100% of the system’s designed capacity, all 
the primary water will flow into the secondary circuits. This is very rare though and is usually only 1% of the year. 
The other 99% of the year the system will be operating at part load, in this scenario only some of the primary water 
will flow into the secondary circuits and some will pass straight through and head back to the chiller or boilers.<br><br>
The primary circuit will often have pumps running at a constant speed. Newer designs may have variable flow primary 
pumps although a minimum flow rate must be ensured. In both cases the chiller or boiler manufacturers will specify 
a minimum flow rate that must be achieved, if the flow rate falls below this, the chiller or boiler can freeze or 
overheat which may result in catastrophic failure.
